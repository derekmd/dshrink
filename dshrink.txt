Title                   : Dshrink v1.0
Filename                : dshrink.exe
Release date            : August 20, 1994
Author                  : Rand Phares

Description             : Dshrink is a program for removing redundant
                          sidedefs from PWADS.  It turns out that PWADS
                          don't need all the sidedefs they typically come
                          with.

                          If two sidedefs in the same sector are identical,
                          DOOM2 can just as easily paint both walls using
                          either sidedef, making the other redundant.

                          Dshrink greatly reduces the size of PWADS,
                          typically removing over 50% of the sidedefs.  

                          Also, since PWADS are examined dynamically as
                          DOOM2 runs, smaller PWADS should mean a faster
                          game.

                          See below for usage instructions.

CAVEAT

************** Dshrink's output is useless as input to most level editors.
************** The editor (deu in our case) reads the PWAD just fine, but
************** if you change a sidedef, any other linedefs using it will
************** inherit the change.  This makes editing very painful.

************** DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF WIPING OUT YOUR INPUT FILE BY
************** RENAMING YOUR DSHRINK OUTPUT (TMP.WAD) TO THE NAME OF THE
************** INPUT FILE.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MISTAKES.

===========================================================================
HOW TO USE DSHRINK

After you've done binary space partitioning on your level (bsp, idbsp, etc.)
and assuming dshrink.exe is present in your working directory.

     > dshrink <your_pwad_name>

This doesn't change your PWAD. It creates the file tmp.wad, which you can
then play.  REMEMBER NOT TO RENAME IT BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL PWAD NAME!
THIS WILL MAKE LEVEL EDITING A BIT PAINFUL!

1. This program is only to be used with wads designed to work with the
   registered version of DOOM2.
